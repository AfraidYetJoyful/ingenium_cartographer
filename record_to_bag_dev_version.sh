# ChatGPT said:

# Thanks for the full log ‚Äî this confirms that even with filter_enable:=false, the driver is still attempting to configure low-pass filters, which is unexpected and problematic. This is very likely a bug in the ROS 2 Jazzy version of microstrain_inertial_driver, specifically how it handles filter_enable and filter_manual_config.
# üîç What‚Äôs Going Wrong?

# Despite setting:

# filter_enable:=false

# and possibly:

# filter_manual_config:=false

# You're still seeing:

# [microstrain_inertial_driver]: Configuring low pass filter with: ...
# [FATAL] Failed to configure node

# That shouldn't happen. This confirms that the filter_enable check is not properly respected in the driver code, and it's proceeding to configure filters on a device that doesn't support that command, leading to failure.
# ‚úÖ Workaround: Disable Filter Config Code at Source

# To truly resolve this, you should:
# 1. ‚úÖ Clone the source version of the driver:

# cd ~/ros2_ws/src
# git clone --branch ros2 https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/microstrain_inertial.git

# 2. üß© Edit microstrain_config.cpp

# Edit the file:

# nano ~/ros2_ws/src/microstrain_inertial/microstrain_inertial_driver/src/microstrain_config.cpp

# Find and comment out or disable this section (approx. lines 378‚Äì425):

# // These configure the low-pass filters ‚Äî disable them:
# if (RCLParamUtils::getParamOrWarn(node_, "filter_manual_config", filter_manual_config_))
# {
#   // Comment out this whole block to prevent filter config
#   // configureLowPassFilter(0x04, ...);
#   // configureLowPassFilter(0x05, ...);
#   // configureLowPassFilter(0x06, ...);
# }

# 3. üîß Rebuild the driver:

# cd ~/ros2_ws
# colcon build --packages-select microstrain_inertial_driver
# source install/setup.bash

# 4. üöÄ Re-launch:

# Now try running your launch file again:

# ros2 launch microstrain_inertial_driver microstrain_launch.py \
#   port:=/dev/ttyACM0 \
#   baudrate:=115200 \
#   imu_enable:=true \
#   gnss1_enable:=false \
#   gnss2_enable:=false \
#   filter_enable:=false \
#   filter_manual_config:=false

# This time, the node should skip filter configuration entirely ‚Äî and run successfully.
# üìù Summary
# Issue	Fix
# Driver crashes trying to configure low-pass filters	Caused by device not supporting them
# filter_enable:=false not working	Bug in driver
# Real fix	Build from source, patch config logic to skip filter setup

# Would you like me to help you prepare a minimal patch file or give you an exact diff to apply?
